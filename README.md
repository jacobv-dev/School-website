# School website - IT project

* Hi, this is my first git repository and I want to test it with my school project. 

* This is a website development with the help of HTML, CSS, JS and maybe **more**  in the future ğŸ˜‰

* I will be continuously adding my work here and you can either download the whole code and try it yourself, or find it on the page where the website runs -> [Junglee](http://109.231.158.142:82/beta/web/x23vorejak/) ğŸŒ´
